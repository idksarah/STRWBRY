STRWBRY is primarily for students/parents who know Spanish and are currently learning English, but anyone is free to use it :&#41; STRWBRY's job is pretty simple â€” highlight a word (either by double clicking or dragging the mouse) and a popup of that word with the Spanish translation(s) and a button for the English pronunciation will appear. Should be very helpful for English learning, since it aids the meaning and pronunciation aspect of the process.
Notes<br/>
-Highlighting multiple words will create a popup that can play the text-to-speech version of the highlighted text but will show no definition, since this was built using a Spanish-English dictionary API rather than a translator API. I may adjust this in the future so that this is more usable in different contexts and languages.<br/>
-Certain words don't have a direct Spanish translation or a formal English definition, so the extension cannot provide the Spanish meaning, but oh well!<br/>
